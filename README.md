# Trivadis LAB Environment

This repository contains *Trivadis LAB* a VM based environment for testing and engineering various Oracle features and use cases. The various environments are based on Oracle VM VirtualBox and are provisioned with Vagrant. The Oracle VM VirtualBox images themselves are based on Oracle's [Oracle Linux Box](https://yum.oracle.com/boxes/) or [Stefan Scherrer's Windows Box](https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer) from the Vagrant Cloud. As shown in the figure below, Trivadis LAB was initially set up for engineering in the context of Oracle Enterprise User Security, Centrally Managed Users and Kerberos. However, the corresponding VMs can also be used individually or in combination for all kind of use- and test cases. More detailed information on Trivadis LAB is available in the [doc](doc) folder or in the [LAB and Example](labs) folder.
